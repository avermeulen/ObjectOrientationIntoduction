# Toy car domain

As a toy manufacturer I need software that can control the lights and sounds of a toy car. The software for should be able to switch on the car's headlights. When the car breaks the breaklights should go on and then go of after 3 seconds. When the car turns left or right the indicators should should flickr either left or right, they should switch of after 3 seconds. The software should support a configurable duration horn. Use the supplied hardware to create software that our engineers would be able to easily integrate into our project.
